Hello friends, enemies, and everyone in between,

Iâ€™m **@PinkBanshi (she/her)** and this will act as a portfolio of sorts for my cyber journey. 

I have worked in cyber tool development (coding focused cyber tools) for the past two years, but want to venture more into the **pentesting**, or **purple team** side of cyber. 
Current focus:
- Web API hacking (following through No Starch Press' API Hacking)
- Industrial Control Systems
- CTFs and associated write ups

If you want to connect about non-cyber things, start with the following:
- Cats (especially if pictures are involved)
- Music 
- Diveristy/ Inclusion
- Acrobatics & Performance-based Sports *(trapeze, aerials, gymnastics, stunting, etc.)*

Feel free to connect via email **banshi.hacks@gmail.com**
